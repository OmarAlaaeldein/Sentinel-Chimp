# Sentinel Chimp 🛡️

**Sentinel Chimp** is a sophisticated, Python-based market analysis dashboard designed for retail traders who demand institutional-grade mathematics. It bridges the gap between basic charting tools and professional quantitative platforms, featuring advanced options pricing models, volatility forecasting, and real-time technical analysis.

> **⚠️ Release Note:** The standalone executable (Release Package) operates in **"Lite Mode"** for maximum compatibility. It **does not include** the AI Sentiment Analysis engine to keep file sizes manageable and ensure it runs on any Windows machine without heavy dependencies. To use the AI features, run the application from the source.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Advanced Options Valuation
Unlike standard calculators that use Black-Scholes, Sentinel uses the **Bjerksund-Stensland (2002)** model to price American options.
* **Log-Space Algebra:** Prevents mathematical overflow/underflow during extreme volatility events.
* **Dynamic Risk-Free Rate:** Automatically adjusts the risk-free rate based on treasury yields (^IRX) and stock-specific growth drift.
* **Edge Detection:** Scans option chains to find contracts where the Market Price diverges significantly from the Theoretical Value (EV).
* **3D Landscape Visualization:** Interactive 3D plotting of "Strike vs. Expiry vs. Expected Value," allowing you to visually spot "islands of value" across the entire option chain.

### 2. Institutional Volatility Forecasting
Sentinel looks beyond simple Historical Volatility (HV).
* **GARCH(1,1) Model:** Implements a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model to forecast *future* volatility rather than just looking at the past.
* **Smart Blending:** Option pricing inputs are a weighted blend of Market Implied Volatility and the GARCH forecast to find a realistic "fair value".

### 3. Smart Technical Dashboard
A threaded, non-blocking GUI featuring a professional Dark Mode interface optimized for low eye strain:
* **Momentum:** RSI (14), Stoch RSI, MACD.
* **Trend Strength:** ADX (Average Directional Index) to distinguish between trending and chopping markets.
* **Volume Analysis:** OBV (On-Balance Volume) trend detection and **VWAP Gap** analysis (Intraday Bull/Bear control).
* **Risk:** ATR (Average True Range) for volatility-based stop losses.
* **Fundamental Context:** Displays P/E Ratios (TTM/Fwd) and calculates a **P/E Percentile** to show if the stock is historically cheap or expensive.

### 4. AI Sentiment Engine (Source Code Only)
* **Model:** Powered by `ProsusAI/finbert` (Financial BERT).
* **Function:** Scrapes news headlines (Yahoo/Google RSS) and computes a sentiment score (-1 to +1) using a Transformer model specifically fine-tuned for financial text.
* *Note: Requires PyTorch and Transformers libraries.*

## 📦 Compatibility & Release Info

To ensure this tool works on standard trading laptops without requiring NVIDIA GPUs or massive libraries, the **pre-compiled Release Package** differs from the source code:

| Feature | Source Code (`.py`) | Release Package (`.exe`) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Charting & Technicals** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Bjerksund-Stensland Math** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **GARCH Volatility** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Options Scanner** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **3D Visualizer** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **AI Sentiment (FinBERT)** | ✅ **Active** | ❌ **Disabled** |

**Why is AI disabled in the release?**
The AI engine relies on `PyTorch` and `Transformers`, which can add over 1GB to the file size and may cause compatibility issues on computers without specific drivers. The Release Package is optimized for speed and portability.
